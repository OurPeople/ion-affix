# ion-affix

This is the OurPeople fork of the `jonaszuberbuehler/ion-affix` repository. The original readme was renamed to `ORIGINAL-README.md`.

This fork allows us to:

- Fix issue https://github.com/jonaszuberbuehler/ion-affix/issues/28
- Use the fixed library as an NPM dependency without submitting it to NPM

Docker can be used if a local NPM binary is not available.

```sh
$ docker-compose run package bash
```
